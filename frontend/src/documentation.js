        <h3 align ='left'>PROBLEM</h3>
            <p align = 'left'>In this automated world, searching for a tutor for a subject is a difficult job. What about Social media? I donâ€™t think, It has gotten so crowded that your skills might not be noticed, only celebrities have higher edge.
Through our web application (Learnerâ€™s Connect), students can connect with tutors to gain knowledge or skills in a particular field.
Based on studentâ€™s selection, the tutor will have special classes and this will occur through notifications
